# Refactor Agent Files to Utilize Hath0r AgentGraph Substrate

## Repository Context
- **Repository**: `OpenSource/hath0r-poc`
- **System Archetype / Role**: Machine Interface & Contract Validation
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11 / POC Adapters / JSON Schemas
- **Primary Subsystems**: `src`, `contracts`, `test`
- **Current Agent Files**: `AGENTS.md`, `test/AGENTS.md`, `contracts/AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `cfg/AGENTS.md`, `lib/AGENTS.md` (+1 more) (7 total)
- **Current AgentGraph Snapshot**: Initialized (27 nodes, 6 edges)

## Architectural Purpose

Under **CR-BAI-001** and the **Hath0r Zero-Prompt-Tax Governance** model, storing static policies, rules, and tool authorizations as monolithic Markdown documents in `AGENTS.md` wastes 40%–60% of LLM context windows and introduces probabilistic security bypasses. 

This work refactors this repository's agent configuration into the deterministic **AgentGraph Quad-Graph Substrate** (KnowledgeGraph, ContextGraph, MemoryGraph, and RuleDAG).

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Inventory & De-duplicate Agent Prompts
- Audit all existing `AGENTS.md` files (root and subsystems).
- Strip out static prompt-stuffing, duplicate headers, and obsolete instructions.
- Ensure only essential repository identity, UPL layout, and operational pointers remain.

### Step 2: Initialize / Synchronize AgentGraph Substrate
- Run `hath0r agentgraph sync` (or `./bin/hath0r-bootstrap.sh`) to extract all local subsystem rules into `.hath0r/agentgraph/snapshot.json`.
- Verify contracts under `contracts/*.schema.json` are registered in the Knowledge plane.
- Classify repository rules into mathematical precedence tiers:
  - **Tier 4 (Org Invariants)**: `CR-*` policies (e.g. `CR-CLI-ENTRY-001`, `CR-BAI-001`).
  - **Tier 3 (Repository Standards)**: Product-level standards and conventions.
  - **Tier 2 (Subsystem Rules)**: Scoped rules in `src`, `contracts`, `test`.
  - **Tier 1 (Role Guidelines)**: Role-specific instructions.

### Step 3: Define Deterministic Agent Roles (RBAC)
- Define explicit agent roles in the Rule plane:
  - `role:developer`: Permitted (`read_file`, `write_file`, `run_command`, `search_code`), Forbidden (`direct_push_master`).
  - `role:reader`: Permitted (`read_file`, `search_code`), Forbidden (`run_command`, `write_file`, `git_push`).
  - Domain-specific roles tailored to `Machine Interface & Contract Validation`.
- Attach `RESTRICTED_BY` and `GOVERNS` edges between rules and roles.

### Step 4: Refactor AGENTS.md for Dynamic Substrate Resolution
- Update root `AGENTS.md` and subsystem `AGENTS.md` files with the canonical AgentGraph block:
  ```markdown
  ## AgentGraph Substrate
  This repository is governed by the Hath0r AgentGraph substrate.
  Dynamic rule retrieval, role RBAC, and policy graphs are stored under `.hath0r/agentgraph/`.
  - Query status: `hath0r agentgraph status`
  - Query rules: `hath0r agentgraph query "<topic>"`
  - Route role: `hath0r agentgraph route --role <role>`
  - Validate rules: `hath0r agentgraph validate`
  ```

### Step 5: Integrate Graph Validation into Quality Gates & CI
- Add `hath0r agentgraph validate` to repository build/test scripts and GitHub Actions workflows.
- Verify zero cyclic dependencies, zero contradictions, and zero orphan edges during every pull request.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `.hath0r/agentgraph/snapshot.json` exists, is committed, and is up-to-date with all local rules.
- [ ] `hath0r agentgraph validate` passes with 0 errors and 0 contradictions.
- [ ] All `AGENTS.md` files reference dynamic AgentGraph commands rather than static prompt-stuffing.
- [ ] Subsystem roles and permitted/forbidden tool boundaries are mathematically deterministic.
